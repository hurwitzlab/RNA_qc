#[-h]         = This helpful help screen.
#[-a ADAPTER] = ADAPTER string. default is CCTTAAGG (dummy adapter).
#[-l N]       = discard sequences shorter than N nucleotides. default is 5.
#[-d N]       = Keep the adapter and N bases after it.
#(using '-d 0' is the same as not using '-d' at all. which is the default).

#[-C]         = Discard clipped sequences (i.e. - keep only sequences which did not contained the adapter).
#[-k]         = Report Adapter-Only sequences.
#[-n]         = keep sequences with unknown (N) nucleotides. default is to discard such sequences.
#[-v]         = Verbose - report number of sequences.
#If [-o] is specified,  report will be printed to STDOUT.
#If [-o] is not specified (and output goes to STDOUT),
